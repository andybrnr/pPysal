The `tet1` files run a super simple test on each of the nodes of the GeoDa Cluster.  The process is:

1. Use `pbsnodes -a` to get a list of the nodes.
2. Parse the list and get only those nodes that report up.
3. Explicitly assign an 8 core job to each node independently.
4. The job:
    i. imports numpy and pysal
    ii. version checks both
    iii. confirms that 8 cores are reporting
    iv. reports maximum wall time
5. The mother then writes to a log fil.
6. A parsing script checks to see if nodes never responded or runtime was too long (single tail, z-test).

To run (might need to chmod +x):

./test1.sh
